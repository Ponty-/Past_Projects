This was the first assignment for CSSE2002 (Programming in the Large).
We had to write and test code for a trio of classes based around determining the potential outcomes of a series of coin flips (see assignment sheet).

The assignment was written in Java using Eclipse. The classes I implemented were the ConditionalTwoCoinChannel, KnowledgeDistribution and TwoCoinChannel in the csse2002.security package.
