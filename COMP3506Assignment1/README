This was the first assignment for COMP3506 (Data Structures and Algorithms).
As detailed in the included assignment sheet, we had to find and correct errors using included JUnit tests, write a simple but efficient portfolio class, and perform a series of tasks based around Binary trees.

The assignment was written in Java using Eclipse.
